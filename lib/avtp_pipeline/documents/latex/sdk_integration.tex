Integrating the O\+P\+E\+N\+A\+VB A\+VB stack into a larger solution can be conceptually divided into 2 parts. The first is the configuration and start up of the A\+VB components such as g\+P\+TP and A\+V\+TP. The second part is the configuration of the streams that will be active. The details of stream configuration is described in another section.

Only a handful of functions are needed to control the A\+V\+TP component. This is done indirectly when opening, running and closing talkers and listeners. The general flow is\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item openavb\+T\+L\+Initialize() is called to initialize the openavb\+\_\+tl module.
\item openavb\+T\+L\+Open() is called one or more times to load talkers and listeners.
\item openavb\+T\+L\+Configure() is called for each talker or listener.
\item openavb\+T\+L\+Run() is called for each talker and listener to start their stream.
\item openavb\+T\+L\+Close() is called for each talker and listener to stop the stream and close.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Controlling the non-\/\+A\+V\+TP components of the A\+VB stack are platform dependent. Release notes for the specific port should be referenced for those details.
